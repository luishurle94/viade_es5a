== Building Block View
This section will show the static decomposition of the system into building blocks as well as their dependencies. We will zoom into black boxes of the different levels to show their components. 

For reference, we are going to use the scope and context diagram that has been described in the third section of the documentation.

Motivation::
The motivation of this diagram is to have a general vision of all different modules of the application.

=== Level 1
